# This folder contains files related to TS-DAR tutorials for Villin Headpiece (HP35)
1. Python notebook for Villin Headpiece (HP35): (./HP35.ipynb)
2. Featurized MD trajectories are available at Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/16922765/files/HP35.zip?download=1]
3. Examples of trained models ./trained_model_examples/
4. The Phython code to train the TS-DAR models is available at ./trained_model_examples/train.py

Note: In the notebook, the directory paths are set to ./data/ for the featurized dataset and ./trained_model_examples/ for the trained models. Keep the data/ and trained_model_examples/ folders in the same directory as the notebook. If you store them elsewhere, update the paths in the notebook before running the code.
